    Ramtek is approximately 50 KM away from the city of Nagpur. A must visit place for the history enthusiasts. 
    There is a temple dedicated to Lord Rama from whom the name was given. Ramtek hosts the historic temple of 
    Rama. It is believed that Ramtek was the place where Rama, the Hindu god, rested while he was in exile.
     According to Hindu history the ashram of the Hindu sage Agastya was situated close to Ramtek. The present 
     temple was built by Raghuji Bhonsale, the Maratha ruler of Nagpur in 18th century after his victory over
      fort of Deogarh in Chindwara. This place is also related to the Sanskrit poet Kalidasa. It is believed that
       Kalidasa wrote MeghadÅ«ta in the hills of Ramtek.
